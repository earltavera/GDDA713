1. Data & Processing Enhancements
The core strength of the dashboard is its data extraction. Here’s how it could be made even more robust and insightful.
•	Deeper Condition Analysis: You currently extract the entire block of "Consent Conditions." The next step is to analyze this text.
o	Suggestion: Use an LLM or NLP techniques (like keyword/phrase extraction) to categorize conditions. After extracting the conditions block, you could run another function to tag it with labels like "Dust Management," "Noise Monitoring," "Chemical Storage," "Reporting Required," or "Complaints Management." This would enable powerful new filtering capabilities, allowing users to find all consents with specific types of obligations.
•	Handle Geocoding Failures Gracefully: The current code silently fails on addresses that geopy cannot parse.
o	Suggestion: Create a "Geocoding Issues" section in the dashboard. Maintain a list of addresses that failed to geocode. Display this list in a small table, perhaps with an input box next to each, allowing the user to manually correct the address and re-trigger the geocoding for that single entry. This improves data completeness without requiring a full re-upload.
•	Hybrid Extraction (Regex + LLM): The extract_metadata function relies on a large set of regular expressions, which can be brittle if PDF formats change.
o	Suggestion: Create a hybrid extraction system. For each piece of metadata, first attempt extraction with your proven regex patterns. If a pattern fails to find a match (e.g., returns "Unknown"), make a targeted API call to an LLM (like Gemini or Groq) with a prompt like: "Extract only the 'Expiry Date' from the following text in DD-MM-YYYY format. If it is not present, return 'None'. Text: {text_blob}". This combines the speed and low cost of regex with the flexibility and resilience of LLMs as a fallback.
2. UI/UX & Interactivity
The user experience is already good, but greater interactivity can make the dashboard even more intuitive.
•	Implement Persistent State: Currently, uploading new files likely triggers a full rerun, replacing the old data.
o	Suggestion: Use Streamlit's Session State (st.session_state) to store the main DataFrame. This allows you to build an "Add Files" feature. A user can upload an initial set of PDFs, and then upload more later, which get appended to the existing DataFrame in the session state. This makes the dashboard feel more like a persistent application rather than a one-off script.
•	Make Charts Interactive Filters: The bar chart and map are excellent visualizations but are currently static displays.
o	Suggestion: Turn them into interactive controls. For example, by using callbacks or state management, you can make it so that clicking the "Expired" bar in the px.bar chart automatically filters the main data table and the map to show only the expired consents.
•	Add a "Detailed View" Modal: To see the full text of conditions or the proposal, a user must find the PDF.
o	Suggestion: In the main consent table (st.dataframe), add a "View Details" button for each row. Clicking this button would open an st.dialog or an expander showing all the extracted data for that specific consent, including the full (and formatted) text of the "Reason for Consent" and "Consent Conditions."
•	Historical & Time-Series Analysis: The dashboard is a "snapshot" of the current data. Add a historical perspective.
o	Suggestion: Add a new chart showing "Consents Issued by Year" or "Consents Expiring by Year." This is a simple value_counts() on the year of the 'Issue Date' and 'Expiry Date' columns and can be plotted with a line or bar chart to reveal trends over time.
3. AI & LLM Feature Upgrades
The AI features have massive potential. Here's how to take them to the next level.
•	Context-Aware AI Chat (RAG): The current chatbot sends the entire data context with every query, which can be inefficient and hit token limits.
o	Suggestion: Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. When a user asks a question in the chat:
1.	First, use the sentence-transformers model (which you already have) to find the top 3-5 most relevant documents from the uploaded PDFs based on the chat query.
2.	Then, pass only the text or data from these specific documents to the LLM as context.
3.	Adjust the system prompt to: "You are an assistant. Answer the user's query based strictly on the following RELEVANT consent information..." This will result in faster, cheaper, and often more accurate answers, as the LLM is not distracted by irrelevant data.
•	Streaming LLM Responses: The chatbot waits for the full answer from the API before displaying it.
o	Suggestion: Implement streaming. Both Gemini and Groq support streaming responses. Use Streamlit's st.write_stream to display the AI's answer token-by-token as it's generated. This dramatically improves the perceived performance and makes the chatbot feel much more interactive and responsive.
•	Source Citations in AI Answers: To build user trust, the AI should show its work.
o	Suggestion: Modify the AI's system prompt to require citations. For example: "When you provide a piece of information, you MUST cite the 'Company Name' and 'Resource Consent Numbers' it came from in brackets, like this: [Company Name, RC12345].". This allows users to immediately verify the AI's claims against the data table.
•	Suggested AI Queries: Guide the user on what's possible.
o	Suggestion: Add a few buttons above the AI chat input with pre-defined questions like, "Which consents expire in the next 6 months?", "List all companies in Penrose", or "What are the most common AUP triggers?". This not only helps the user get started but also subtly teaches them how to formulate effective queries.
