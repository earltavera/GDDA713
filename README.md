Auckland Air Discharge Consent Dashboard
Interactive AI-powered dashboard for exploring industrial air discharge consents across Auckland, New Zealand.
This tool enables semantic search, geospatial mapping, and automated metadata extraction from unstructured PDF consent documents.

How to Use the Auckland Air Discharge Consent Dashboard
This guide will walk you through the features of the dashboard and how to use them to analyze your air discharge consent documents.

Step 1: Getting Started - Upload Your Documents
The dashboard is powered by the PDF consent documents you provide.

Locate the Control Panel in the sidebar on the left-hand side of the screen.
Click the "Browse files" button within the "Upload PDF files" section.
Select one or more air discharge consent PDF documents from your computer. You can upload multiple files at once.
Once uploaded, the dashboard will automatically process the files. This may take a few moments. After processing, the main dashboard will populate with data.
Step 2: Understanding the Main Dashboard View
Once your documents are processed, the main panel provides an immediate overview of your consent portfolio.

Header Banner: At the top, you'll find the current date, time, and weather for Auckland.
Summary Metrics: Four key figures give you a high-level summary:
Total Consents: The total number of documents you uploaded.
Expiring in 90 Days: The number of active consents that are due to expire within the next 90 days.
Expired: The total number of consents that have already passed their expiry date.
Truly Active: The number of consents that are current and not expiring within the next 90 days.
Consent Status Overview: This bar chart visually breaks down the status of all uploaded consents (e.g., Active, Expired, Unknown).
Step 3: Interacting with Your Data
You can explore your data in detail using the expandable sections.

Consent Table:

Click on the expander to view a detailed table of all consents.
Use the "Filter by Status" dropdown menu to narrow the list to a specific category (e.g., only show "Expired" consents).
Click the "Download CSV" button to save the currently filtered data to a spreadsheet for offline analysis.
Consent Map:

Click on the expander to see the consent locations on a map of Auckland.
Each pin represents a consent, color-coded by its status.
Hover your mouse over a pin to see key details like the company name, address, and expiry date.
Step 4: Finding Specific Information
The dashboard offers two powerful ways to search for information within your documents.

Semantic Search: Use this to find documents based on concepts and meaning, not just keywords.

In the sidebar, type your query into the "Semantic Search Query" text box (e.g., "concrete batching plant dust mitigation").
The results will instantly appear in the "Semantic Search Results" section on the main panel.
Each result shows the company, address, and a similarity score. You can adjust the "Relevance Threshold" slider to hide less relevant results.
Click the "Download PDF" button next to any result to open the original source document.
AI Chatbot: Ask complex questions about the entire dataset in plain English.

Expand the "AI Chatbot" section at the bottom of the page.
Choose your preferred AI provider (Gemini or Groq).
Type your question into the text area. Examples of good questions include:
"Which companies have consents that expire in 2025?"
"List all consents located in Penrose."
"What are the most common mitigation measures mentioned?"
Click the "Ask AI" button. The AI will analyze the data from all uploaded documents and provide a summarized answer.
To keep a record of your interactions, click the "Download Chat History (CSV)" button.
Troubleshooting & Tips
No data is showing: Ensure you have successfully uploaded PDF files using the uploader in the sidebar.
The map is empty or missing points: This can happen if a document does not contain a recognizable address that can be located. Check the "Address" column in the Consent Table for "Unknown" values.
The AI is thinking for a long time: Processing queries, especially with many large documents, can take a few moments. Please be patient.
"Unknown" values: If the dashboard shows "Unknown" for a field, it means the information could not be automatically extracted from the text of that specific PDF document.
