# Pin these core ML libraries to compatible versions for Python 3.9
# These specific versions have a good track record together:
torch==2.0.1+cpu              # Use a torch 2.x version with CPU only for Streamlit Cloud (avoids CUDA dependency issues)
transformers==4.28.1          # Compatible with torch 2.0.1
sentence-transformers==2.2.2  # This should now work well with transformers 4.28.1
huggingface_hub==0.13.4       # This version is known to work with transformers 4.28.1
